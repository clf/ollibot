= Automata = 

== Finite state automata ==
* [[parity.olf | Parity]]

== Pushdown automata ==
* [[parens.olf | Matching parens]]

== Turing machines ==
* [[inc.olf          | Incrementing a binary number]]
* [[double.olf       | Doubling a number]]
* [[busybeaver3.olf  | Busy beaver, 3-state, 2-symbol]]
* [[busybeaver4.olf  | Busy beaver, 4-state, 2-symbol]]
  - enough tape is provided
* [[busybeaver4b.olf | Busy beaver, 4-state, 2-symbol]]
  - tape is dynamically extended
* [[busybeaver5.olf  | Busy beaver, 5-state, 2-symbol]] 
  - at least we think so...
