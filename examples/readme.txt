This subdirectories of this directory describe several different uses for
ordered linear logic.

The descriptions contain links to some code examples; click on the links for
a better description of the directory's contents.

=== [[lics09/readme.txt   | LICS 2009 Code]] ===

In this examples based on the paper ''Substructural Operational Semantics
as Ordered Logic Progamming'' by Pfenning & Simmons (LICS 2009). 
Includes examples animating all of the figures from that paper.

=== [[automata/readme.txt | Automata]] ===

Contains implementations of several types of automata encoded in a number of
styles, such as [[automata/parity.olf|determinstic finite automata]] for 
evaluating parity, [[automata/parens.olf|push-down automata]] for checking
matching parentheses, and several types of turing machines.

=== [[ml5/lambda5.olf | Lambda 5]] ===

A formalization of ''A Symmetric Modal Lambda Calculus for Distributed 
Computing'' by Murphy et al., which describes a mobile programming langauge.
A subsequent version of this langauge was implemented in Tom Murphy VII's
thesis work as a distributed web programming langauge.
