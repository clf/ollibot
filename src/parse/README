Combinator parsing.

You must first include stream-sig.sml and stream.sml from the ../util/
directory. You may find the streamutils found there interesting as well.

SimpleTok is optional. It's designed to lower the "barrier to entry"
for writing parsers. Just create a tokenizer and put in some settings
(beginning and ending strings for comments, etc.) and it will try to
"do the right thing" for you. Great for parsing config files.
