Algorithms.

toposort       -   Generate a topological sort of some items with
                   ordering constraints of the form "a must appear
                   before b".

heap           -   Efficient implementation of binary heaps, supporting
                   insertion, deletion, find_min and update.

rsync          -   The rsync rolling hash algorithm.

edit-distance  -   Computes the edit distance between two strings using
                   the classic dynamic programming algorithm.

lzw            -   Full implementation of Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression
                   and decompression over arbitrary alphabets. Compressor
                   can also output a slightly degraded bit compatible 
                   format that simplifies the decompression algorithm.

hillclimb      -   Very simple generic hill-climbing optimization.
