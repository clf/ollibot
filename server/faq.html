<b>When I open the server it give me a message "Error trying to bind 
..."</b><br><br>
Change the port in configuration, close services using the port you 
want<br>
And check if you don't opened two servers<br>

<br><b>When I open the server I got "Some lib isn't 
installed"(rare)</b><br><br>
Sometimes the program WILL show a error if you get this message<br>
and in this error will be the lib name, just download and install<br>

<br><b>How I make to obelisk-http reconigze .php files?</b><br>
Open obelisk-http.py, search for  '#CONFIG' inside it you will find a 
<br>variable called PHP='/usr/bin/php' where is writen 
'/usr/bin/php' you must put the path to PHP<br>(C:/php/php.exe on most 
windows systems)

<br><b>Ok PHP runs, but where are the variables when I call the 
page?</b><br>The variables are encoded inside $REQUEST to decode you 
must do:<br>
$REQUEST=explode('&amp;',$REQUEST);<br>
foreach($REQUEST as $r){<br>
	$r=explode("=",$r);<br>
	$VARIABLE[$r[0]]=$VARIABLE[$r[1]];<br>
}<br><br>
This will returna array in $VARIABLE who cold be used like $_GET<br>
just call $VARIABLE['VARNAME'] and you will got the variable value
